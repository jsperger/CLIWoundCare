# Task 1

On 3 February 2021, Kate sent an e-mail with the draft manuscript and requested a few additional number and an updated to a plot.

## Limb salvage and survival 

Some of these measures required were added to the preprocessing document

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

analyticData <- readr::read_csv("/Users/Nikki/Dropbox/Consulting_github/CLIWoundCare/1.DataPreparation/analyticData.csv")

analyticData %>% group_by(primaryProcedure) %>%
  summarise(1-sum(majorAmp1yr)/n(), 1-sum(majorAmp2yr)/n())

analyticData %>% 
  summarise(1-sum(majorAmp1yr)/n(), 1-sum(majorAmp2yr)/n())

analyticData %>%
  summarise(1-sum(mort1yr)/n(), 1-sum(mort2yr)/n())
```

## New Figure 1

```{r}
# Data comes from the report
outcome <- c("Two-year Amputation-Free Survival",
             "Two-year Survival",
             "Two-year Amputation",
             "Two-year MACE")
pointEstimate <- c(51, 65, 19, 17)
LB <- c(40, 54, 10, 8)
UB <- c(63, 76, 29, 25)

pData <- data.frame(outcome, pointEstimate, LB, UB) %>%
  mutate(label = paste0(pointEstimate, "% [", LB, "%, ", UB, "%]"))

fig1 <- pData %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pointEstimate, y = outcome)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = LB, xmax = UB),
                 height = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), size = 2.3, vjust = -1.5) +
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = rev(outcome), 
                   labels = rev(outcome), 
                   limits = rev(outcome)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 10, to = 70, by = 10),
                     labels = paste0(seq(from = 10, to = 70, by = 10), "%")) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("Percent") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y =  element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) 

ggsave(fig1, filename = "fig1.png", device = "png", width = 6, height = 3)
